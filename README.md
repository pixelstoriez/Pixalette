# Pixalette
Pixalette is a cartoony pixel art resource pack for Minecraft with rich, vibrant colors and simplistic textures that I've been working on in my freetime for the past few years.

Many textures in this pack utilise Dawnbringer 32, a palette which was created by Richard "DawnBringer" Fhager. You can find the original artist and palette [here](https://pixeljoint.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=12795).
